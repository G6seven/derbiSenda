# how to rebuild brakes

## Rear brakes
### Bill of Materials
* Rear brakes have 32mm piston diameter so yu are going to need a [rebuild kit](https://www.proskutry.cz/p/sada-na-opravu-brzdoveho-trmenu-naraku-32x13mm/) for that, the kit includes 2 pistons, 2 seals and 1 O-ring 
* DOT-4 brake fluid
* 2x M8   bolt
* 2x 10mm copper waher 

### Tips
these are the tools I use and what will make your job lot smoother,
* Use air compressor to pressure the calipers, the pistons will fly out so be aware of potential risk of being shot by a 32mm piston, 
* Use new copper washers everytime you tighten the brake lines
