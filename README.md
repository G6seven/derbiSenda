# Derbi Senda
This repository server as documentation for development of my bike. 

##as time went
bought the bike in 2020 looking like piece of crap, got it running, drove it for some time, disassembled it completely, bought some upgrade parts and got engine rebuilt.
ot it running again, crashed hard, disassembled it again, decided to do something big, did some mistakes, lost some money, lost motivation, year gone. 
Now I stand here
